# 🎓 E-Learning Platform - Advanced Backend API

A production-ready, feature-rich e-learning platform backend built with NestJS, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript. This project implements industry-standard practices including JWT authentication, role-based authorization, caching, rate limiting, comprehensive API documentation, and admin analytics.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication
- **Role-Based Authorization** - Student, Instructor, and Admin roles
- **Course Management** - Full CRUD with advanced search and filtering
- **Enrollment System** - Track student course enrollments
- **Progress Tracking** - Course-level and lesson-level progress monitoring
- **Review System** - 5-star rating with comments and duplicate prevention
- **Lesson Management** - Structured course content with ordering

### Advanced Features

- **Security Headers** - Helmet.js integration for HTTP security
- **Rate Limiting** - Throttling to prevent abuse (100 req/min)
- **Caching** - In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
- **API Documentation** - Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI docs
- **Admin Dashboard** - Analytics, user/course management, revenue tracking
- **Health Checks** - Database, memory, and disk monitoring

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd coursera-demo
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_password
DATABASE_NAME=coursera_demo

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME=24h

# Application
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000

# CORS
CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

4. **Create database**

```bash
node create-db.js
```

5. **Start the application**

```bash
# Development
npm run start:dev

# Production
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## 📚 API Documentation

Once the server is running, access interactive API documentation at:

- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:3000/api

### Key Endpoints

#### Authentication

```
POST   /auth/register          - Register new user
POST   /auth/login             - Login user
POST   /auth/change-password   - Change password (Protected)
```

#### Courses

```
GET    /courses                - Search & filter courses (cached)
GET    /courses/popular        - Top 10 popular courses (cached)
GET    /courses/:id            - Course details (cached)
POST   /courses                - Create course (Instructor)
POST   /courses/:id/reviews    - Add review (Protected)
POST   /courses/:id/lessons    - Add lesson (Instructor)
```

#### Enrollments

```
POST   /enrollments                              - Enroll in course
GET    /enrollments/my-courses                   - My enrolled courses
GET    /enrollments/stats                        - Enrollment statistics
POST   /enrollments/lessons/:lessonId/progress   - Track lesson progress
```

#### Admin (Admin Role Required)

```
GET    /admin/dashboard          - Dashboard statistics

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Register/Login** → Receive JWT token
2. **Include token** in subsequent requests:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
   ```
3. **Role-based access** automatically enforced by guards

### User Roles

- **Student** - Enroll in courses, leave reviews, track progress
- **Instructor** - Create/manage courses and lessons
- **Admin** - Full platform management and analytics

## 🎯 Advanced Features Explained

### 1. Caching Strategy

Popular courses and course lists are cached for 5-10 minutes to reduce database load.

### 2. Rate Limiting

API endpoints are limited to 100 requests per minute per IP address to prevent abuse.

### 3. Database Indexes

Strategic indexes on:

- User email and role
- Course category, level, price, enrollmentCount, averageRating
- Improves query performance by 10-100x

### 4. Health Monitoring

`/health` endpoint checks:

- Database connectivity
- Memory usage (heap & RSS)
- Disk storage availability

### 5. Admin Analytics

- Total users, courses, enrollments
- Revenue tracking
- Recent enrollment trends
- Top instructors ranking

## 🔍 Search & Filter

The `/courses` endpoint supports advanced querying:

```bash
# Search by text
GET /courses?search=javascript

# Filter by category and level
GET /courses?category=programming&level=beginner

# Price range filter
GET /courses?minPrice=0&maxPrice=50

# Sort options
GET /courses?sort=rating           # Highest rated first
GET /courses?sort=popular          # Most enrolled
GET /courses?sort=newest           # Latest courses
GET /courses?sort=price-asc        # Cheapest first
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Main Entities

- **User** - firstName, lastName, email, password, role, isActive, bio
- **Course** - title, description, price, level, category, thumbnail, averageRating, enrollmentCount
- **Enrollment** - user, course, progress (0-100), completed
- **Review** - user, course, rating (1-5), comment
- **Lesson** - course, title, content, order, videoUrl, duration
- **LessonProgress** - user, lesson, completed, timeSpent
- **Notification** - user, type, message, isRead

### Relationships

- User → Courses (Instructor creates courses)
- User → Enrollments (Student enrolls in courses)
- User → Reviews (Student reviews courses)
- Course → Lessons (Course has many lessons)
- Course → Reviews (Course has many reviews)
